Latitude and longitude coordinates are often written as degrees, minutes, and seconds of arc as follows:
  43°35′53.3″ S, 170°08′33.0″ E
  or as decimal degrees: -43.5981468, 170.1425128

One second of arc (1″) equates to 30m, or 0.00028 in decimal degrees.


The New Zealand Geodetic Datum 2000 (NZGD2000) supercedes NZGD49, which was in use until 1998.
 - There's about a 200m difference between these datums

GPS units use the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84)

NZGD2000 and WGS84 may be considered identical for now — differences are on the scale of 1-2 metres.

Aoraki / Mount Cook is referenced as: 5169132, 1369317.


----------------

Downgrading from 4.8.1 to 3.25. Loader stays the same, but think we need to be loading it locally
rather than online.

From:
"@types/arcgis-js-api": "^4.8.1",

To:
"@types/arcgis-js-api": "3.25.0",


----------------

Getting the ArcGIS library to run offline involved;

1. Using the documentation at;

https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/3/jshelp/intro_accessapi.html

2. Following the "Download" strategy at the bottom of the page

3. Creating a public Developer account to get access to the API

4. Downloading the 3.25 version of the API and unzipping it

5. Reading the install instructions from within the zip file to track down and "Modify the Build" to change the library supplied source code from

6. https://[HOSTNAME_AND_PATH_TO_JSAPI]dojo

7. To the fully qualified hostname and path of where the library will be running (not sure if relative paths work or not yet)

8. Host the library within a web server of some kind at the expected location.

Current size = 129 MB on disk.
 ...though to be fair there are ways of building an application specific version of the library.
