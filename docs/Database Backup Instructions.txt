1. Set PATH to contain Couchbase CLI tools if not done already

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin
export PATH=$PATH:/c/Program\ Files/Couchbase/Server/bin

2. Create the backup somewhere locally

cbbackup http://localhost:8091 D:/ATemp/backups -u Administrator -p <??password??>

From within the Couchbase admin console;

3. From the "Buckets" page. Delete the bucket "kakapo-bird"

5. From the command line Restore the backup into the server

cbrestore D:/ATemp/backups http://localhost:8091 -b kakapo-bird -B kakapo-bird -u Administrator -p <??password??>

cbrestore backups http://localhost:8091 -b kakapo-bird -B kakapo-bird -u Administrator -p

6. Rebuild the primary index

[Linux]   cbq --script="BUILD INDEX ON \`kakapo-bird\` (\`#primary\`)" -u Administrator -p <??password??>
[Windows] cbq --script="BUILD INDEX ON `kakapo-bird` (`#primary`)" -u Administrator -p <??password??>

7. Monitor the indexes page

...after a few seconds if you flip to the "Indexes" page you should see the #Primary change into a
"Building" state and then eventually a "Ready" state

Wait for the #Primary to rebuild.
